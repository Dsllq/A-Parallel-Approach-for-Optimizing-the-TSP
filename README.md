# A Parallel Approach for Optimizing the Traveling Salesman Problem

## Overview
This project focuses on developing a parallel computing solution to efficiently solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). The goal is to determine the shortest possible route that visits a set of cities exactly once and returns to the origin. This is particularly challenging as the number of cities increases, transforming the problem into a highly complex combinatorial task.

## Purpose
The primary objective of this project is to exploit the capabilities of parallel computing to address the inherently combinatorial nature of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). By parallelizing the computation, we aim to decompose the problem into smaller, manageable tasks that can be processed simultaneously. This approach not only significantly enhances the efficiency of computations but also improves the speedup and scalability of the solutions. These improvements are crucial for facilitating the resolution of larger TSP instances, which are impractical to handle with sequential methods, thereby increasing the overall efficiency of the process.
