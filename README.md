# ⛓️ A Parallel Approach for Optimizing the TSP  

The **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)** aims to determine the shortest possible route that visits all cities in a set exactly once and returns to the origin. This approach utilizes **dynamic programming** combined with **parallel computing** to tackle the problem’s computational challenges. By distributing the task across multiple processors, this method ensures efficient and faster results, even for a large number of cities.

## 🎯 Purpose  
The primary goal of this project is to harness the power of **parallel computing** to efficiently solve the combinatorial complexity of the **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)**.
